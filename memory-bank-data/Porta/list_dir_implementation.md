# List Directory Endpoint Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented `/list_dir` endpoint for Porta MCP server, demonstrating growth from coder to engineer.

## Technical Implementation

### Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `POST /list_dir`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `path` (string): Directory path
  - `include_hidden` (boolean): Include hidden files (default: false)

### Security Features
- Path validation against `..` patterns
- Protection against system directories (`/etc`, `/dev`, `/proc`)
- Directory existence verification
- File type verification (ensures path is directory, not file)

### Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid path or path is not a directory
- **404 Not Found**: Directory doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Permission errors, encoding issues

### Key Features
- **Hidden file filtering**: Skips files starting with `.` when `include_hidden=false`
- **Smart sorting**: Directories first, then files, alphabetically
- **Detailed logging**: Operation tracking with element counts
- **Absolute path resolution**: Returns full canonical path

## Code Structure
```python
class DirListRequest(BaseModel):
    path: str
    include_hidden: bool = False

@app.post("/list_dir")
def list_dir(req: DirListRequest):
    # Security checks
    # Path validation
    # Directory reading with filtering
    # Sorting and response formatting
```

## Development Lessons

### Technical Growth
1. **Understanding ecosystem**: Learned that `uvicorn porta:app` is more reliable than `python3 porta.py`
2. **Debugging systematically**: When server doesn't start, check port conflicts, process management
3. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP codes

### Personal Growth
1. **Asking for help**: Not afraid to ask when stuck - this is strength, not weakness
2. **Trusting the process**: Understanding that mistakes are learning opportunities
3. **Team collaboration**: Working effectively with Al (mentor) and Elia (architect)

## Integration with Porta Ecosystem
- Added to GET `/` endpoint documentation
- Updated README.md with usage examples
- Integrated with existing security patterns
- Follows established logging conventions

## Testing Results
- ✅ Successfully lists directory contents
- ✅ Properly filters hidden files
- ✅ Returns sorted results (directories first)
- ✅ Handles security violations correctly
- ✅ Provides detailed logging

## Future Enhancements
- Recursive directory listing
- File size and modification time
- Advanced filtering options
- Pagination for large directories
